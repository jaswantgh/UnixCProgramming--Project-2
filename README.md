## Assignment 2 - Unix and C Programming
**Score Achieved: 98%**

This repository contains the upgraded version of the box terminal maze game, a project developed during my second year of studies.

### New Features:

1. **File I/O Operations:** The game now supports saving and loading of game states. This allows players to continue from where they left off, a feature that significantly improves the gameplay experience.

2. **Color Trail:** A color trail feature has been introduced to mark the player's path. This provides visual assistance to players as they navigate the maze.

3. **Undo Function:** This new feature allows players to revert their last move. It offers greater flexibility and interaction during gameplay.

The game continues to be built in line with the C89 coding standards, with dynamic memory allocation for the map's 2D array managed through the malloc() function.

### Debugging and Memory Checks:
Valgrind was consistently used to detect and fix potential memory leaks or errors, ensuring the code's robustness and integrity.

### Additional Information:
This assignment was a great opportunity to further refine my Unix and C Programming skills, and the addition of these new features presented both exciting challenges and rewarding outcomes.
